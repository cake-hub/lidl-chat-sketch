# Images

The image is a possible responding option to offer the user a simple image to a topic.

It is based on the design of the [CAKE image](/Lidl/Web/Design/General/Image/Image.md).

## Overall styling and usage

- Use the image to **show product images, special events or announcements**.
- The component has **rounded corners of 2px**.
- The image ratio always is **4:3** because most lidl images are photographed in this format.
- Only in this way it can be guaranteed that no information is cut off.
- The sample content should always be adapted to the appropriate aspect ratio.
- The image streches over the **full width** of the chatwindow.

### Our workflow in Sketch

- These symbols are always placeholders.
- These placeholders can later easy be replaced by inserting sample content images.
- To set an image, use the "Overrides" function "Choose Image".
