# Indicator

The indicator gives the user a notification that the bot has sent a new message, which is located in the lower non-visible area of the chat window.

The chatbot interface **only offers text characters**, therefore a unicode font character was used instead of an icon. The browser automatically uses the system font. In Sketch the font Monaco is used.
